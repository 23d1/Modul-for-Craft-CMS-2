# Modul for Craft CMS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###**Modul** is a set of website builder templates for Craft CMS aimed primarily at (but not limited to) creatives, designers, photographers and other visual thinkers who enjoys a nice and tidy grid structure, with the ability to tastefully break it. It is fully fluid and responsive with a lot of features. It's based on a 12-column grid, where you add rows with blocks of various content. Some of that content can even have overlays, which is another 12-column grid of content blocks on top of itâ€”like an image with text, or perhaps another image or video on top of it.
